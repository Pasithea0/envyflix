# EnvyFlix
[![EnvyFlix Image](.github/EnvyFlix.png)](https://envyflix.xyz)  

## Envyflix is a fork of [sudo-flix](https://github.com/sussy-code/smov) with many QoL changes and new features. 

#####  I created this fork to solve my peronal problems with sudo-flix as well as solve other user's issues. As this is just a fork, all docs (and proceding content here) are for sudo-flix. 
If you would like to learn more about the features and changes I have made to EnvyFlix or want to send feedback, join the [EnvyFlix Discord](https://discord.gg/7z6znYgrTG).

**I *do not* endorse piracy of any kind I simply enjoy programming and large user counts.**
